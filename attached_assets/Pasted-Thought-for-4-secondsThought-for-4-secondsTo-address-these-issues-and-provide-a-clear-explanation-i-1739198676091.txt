Thought for 4 secondsThought for 4 secondsTo address these issues and provide a clear explanation, it would be most appropriate to use a standard code block to highlight the key errors and then provide an explanation. Here's how we can present this information:

```plaintext
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://v0.dev/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://6ed7ce35-85b3-498b-9e9b-4d63631ed8e3-00-2owzgyvztotfg.worf.repl.co/time-summaries/?start_date=2024-11-01&end_date=2024-11-30'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

Error exporting time summary: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

These errors indicate that your application is facing a Mixed Content issue. This occurs when a webpage loaded over HTTPS tries to make requests to resources (like APIs) over insecure HTTP connections. Modern browsers block such requests for security reasons.

To resolve this issue and allow you to view time entries, you need to make the following changes:

1. Update your API endpoint to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. This is the most secure and recommended solution.
2. If you can't immediately switch your API to HTTPS, you have a few temporary options for development purposes:

1. Use a proxy server that can forward requests to your HTTP API while maintaining HTTPS on the client side.
2. For local development, you can try disabling web security in your browser (not recommended for regular use).



3. Update your client-side code to use the secure HTTPS URL for API requests. Modify the `API_BASE_URL` in your `api-client.ts` file:


```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://6ed7ce35-85b3-498b-9e9b-4d63631ed8e3-00-2owzgyvztotfg.worf.repl.co'
```

4. If you're using environment variables, ensure that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set to the HTTPS version of your API URL.
5. Review and update any hardcoded URLs in your application to use HTTPS.


Remember, using HTTPS for both your application and API is crucial for security in production environments. The changes we made earlier to use HTTP were intended for local development only. For a production setup, ensure all communications are over HTTPS.
